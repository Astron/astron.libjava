Astron Java Style Guidelines
----------------------------

**Naming**
- Classes should be named using `CamelCase`
- Local variables (including parameters) should use `drinkingCamelCase`
- Method signatures should mark parameters as `final`, with very few exceptions
- Private instance variables should begin with an underscore

**Misc**
- Do not use `@Override`
